# OpenSoundscape

OpenSoundscape ([GitHub](https://github.com/kitzeslab/opensoundscape)) is a utility library for analyzing bioacoustic data.
It consists of command line scripts for tasks such as preprocessing audio data,
training machine learning models to classify vocalizations, estimating the
spatial location of sounds, identifying which species' sounds are present in
acoustic data, and more.

These utilities can be strung together to create data analysis pipelines.
OpenSoundscape is designed to be run on any scale of computer:
laptop, desktop, or computing cluster.

OpenSoundscape is currently in active development. If you find a bug, please submit an issue. If you have another question about OpenSoundscape, please email Sam Lapp (`sam.lapp` at `pitt.edu`) or Tessa Rhinehart (`tessa.rhinehart` at `pitt.edu`).

For examples of some of the utilities offered, please see the "Tutorials" section of the [documentation](https://opensoundscape.org). Included are instructions on how to download and use a pretrained machine learning model from our publicly available set of models. We plan to add additional tutorials soon.

# Installation and tutorials

OpenSoundscape should be run on Python 3.7 and can be installed via pip: `pip opensoundscape==0.4.6`. For more detailed instructions and tutorials, see the documentation.
